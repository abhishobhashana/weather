  "feels_like_desc": "Feels Like conveys how warm or cold it feels and can be different from the actual temperature. The Feels Like temperature is affected by humidity and wind.",
  "uv_index_desc": "The World Health Organization's UV index (UVI) measures ultraviolet radiation. The higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage and the faster harm can occur. The UVI can help you decide when to protect yourself from the sun and when to avoid being outside. The WHO recommends using shade, sunscreen, hats and protective clothing at levels of 3 (Moderate) or higher.",
  "wind_speed_gusts": "Wind Speed and Gusts",
  "wind_desc": "The wind speed is calculated using the average over a short period of time. Gusts are short bursts of wind above this average. A gust typically lasts under 20 seconds.",
  "precipitation_intensity": "Precipitation Intensity",
  "precipitation_desc": "Intensity is calculated based on how much rain or snow falls per hour and is meant to indicate how heavy the rain or snow will feel. It is also used with other precipitation types such as sleet and wintry mix. A downpour or heavy snowstorm can have a heavy intensity, while an average rainfall or lighter drizzle can have a moderate or light intensity.",
  "relative_humidity": "Relative Humidity",
  "humidity_desc": "Relative humidity, commonly known just as humidity, is the amount of moisture in the air compared with what air can hold. The air can hold more moisture at higher temperatures. A relative humidity near 100% means there may be dew or fog.",
  "visibility_desc": "Visibility tells you how far away you can clearly see objects like buildings and hills. It is a measure of the transparency of the air and does not take into account the amount of sunlight or the presence of obstructions. Visibility at or above 10 km is considered clear.",
  "air_quality_desc": " Air Quality indicates the level of pollutants in the air, with the AQI (Air Quality Index) showing how clean or polluted it is. An AQI between 0–50 is considered Good, while higher values indicate poorer air quality. The app tracks key pollutants like PM2.5, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, helping you assess if the air is safe, especially for sensitive individuals.",
  "pressure_desc": "Significant, rapid changes in pressure are used to predict changes in weather. For example, a drop in pressure can mean that rain or snow is on the way, and rising pressure can mean that weather will improve. Pressure is also called barometric pressure or atmospheric pressure.",
  "avg_temp_desc": "Average temperature gives an overview of the day’s typical conditions by showing both the high and low temperatures. The high is usually reached in the afternoon, while the low occurs around dawn. This range helps you understand how warm or cool the day will feel overall."
